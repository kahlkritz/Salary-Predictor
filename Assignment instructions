You have to create a single neuron and train it using one of the learning rules discussed in class.    

The file Saldata.csv contains salary information of 2000 employed individuals.  The first column contains the monthly salary of each person. Successive columns contain other attributes of each individual: Education (number of years of formal education or training after school); NrSupervise (the number of workers that are directly accountable to the individual, i.e. the number of people working under the individual); NrPositions (the number of jobs that the person have had before being employed at their current work); Responsibility (a percentage indicating the amount of responsibility associated with the individual’s job, e.g. a doctor or fireman would have a high responsibility percentage); Number of Children (the number of children that qualify as dependents of the individual); Age (the age of the individual); YearsExperience (the number of years of experience that the individual has in his\her current line of employment).

It is possible to make use of AI techniques to predict the salary of an individual based on the seven attributes mentioned above.  Create a single neuron to act as a salary predictor. The neuron should take as input the seven known attributes of an individual and then output the salary of that individual.  Use the data in Saldata.csv to train your neuron.  Exclude some of the data from the training process so that you can test the effectiveness of your neuron.  Make use of your trained neuron to predict the salaries of the ten individuals found in Evaluation.csv. 

Investigate the effect of varying the learning rate () on training time and accuracy. Complete the submission template for this assignment.  Try to keep the completed template to two pages. Attach your code to your submission.
